A little game. Details forthcoming.

## Origins of Content

Part of (or All) the graphic tiles used in this program is the public domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles".
Some of the tiles have been modified.

You can find the original tileset at: http://rltiles.sf.net

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build Warning

This project contains a parser generated by pegjs. You can regenerate the parser with

    yarn build-parser

Unfortunately, the parser build isn't integrated into the regular build process
at all, and the build product is checked into git. This is a recipie for
disaster, but I'm not quite ready to `yarn eject` and learn how the underlying
sausage is actually made. The punchline is, be careful when changing the parser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
