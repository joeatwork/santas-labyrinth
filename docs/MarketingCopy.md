_Steve, please take a last look at the marketing copy. Once you approve we'll
send it over to Glartha the Mighty to do a final print. Please keep our budget
in mind as you make revisions: it's important to get our message right, but I
don't think we have many more rounds with the catalog before they'll start
asking for more money._

# The Future of Adventuring is NOW

Let's face it: traditional adventuring is a high risk investment. It's dangerous
and error prone even when done by experts, and very difficult to staff in
today's competitive labor environment. Failures are costly and successes are
hard to reproduce. The field of adventuring is ripe for **automation**!

## There is a Better Way

Overworld Consolidated Industries is proud to introduce *Adventurebot 2000*, the
first[^1] fully automated adventurer. Adventurebot 2000 is a fully programmable
adventuring solution, featuring:

* Advanced computing capabilities.
* Complete automatic dungeon mobility.
* Cutting-edge stored proceedure technology.
* A complete library of adventuring software[^2].
* A fully integrated development environment for custom programming.

# An Industrial Revolution in Adventuring!

Be a part of the future of adventuring! The next time you have to find the seven
scepters of virtue hidden in their shrines throughout the world, or defeat the
evil overlord Nekrotek, you'll be able to rely on Adventurebot 2000.

[^1]: While cybernetically enhanced adventurers and robotic teenage adventurers are fairly common, until OCI none of these modes of adventuring has been *truly* automatic.

[^2]: Adventuring software library is still under development but will be included in a future release.
